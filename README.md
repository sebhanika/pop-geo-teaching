# Introduction to Population Geography

This repository includes the scripts and materials for an introductory module in population geography at the Department of Human Geography at Lund University. 
The module is divided into three lectures (8 hours total) which cover the basic processes and drivers in the field of population geography. 

### Slides
Shortly before the first round of lectures, the slides will be uploaded to this folder.

### Materials
The original graphs and maps can be found in this [viszs/] folder structured by the main topics. While the graphs should be easily visible in the presentation it also contains the GIF files which do not work in the PDF files. However, the GIF files are also directly in each respective slide.

### Data 
The data used is sourced from a wide variety of sources but relies heavily on the Human Mortality and Human Fertility databases, 
as well as Eurostat and the World Bank. All of these utilize corresponding R packages to directly load the data into the R sessions,
making many parts of this repository easily reproducible. If alternative data was used, I usually provide links for easy downloading of the data.
