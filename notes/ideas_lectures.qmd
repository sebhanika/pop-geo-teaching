### Ideas for visualizations

The idea is to have a limited number of graphs but that have a lot of information so that different topics can be discussed.

Some ideas:

- Relationship between Life expectancy and gdp per capita
- Record life expectancy
- Life expectancy in Sweden and other countries 
- Migration flows
- Every map is just a map of population density 


### Other notes

- Should I include a trigger warning for child and infant mortality
